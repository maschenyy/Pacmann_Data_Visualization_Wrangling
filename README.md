# Final Project on Data Visualization and Wrangling Pacmann's Module
Below are the results and explanations of the Data Visualization and Wrangling project provided by postman. The project includes analyzing and processing data taken from the Kaggle site. This is not an individual project, so I am teaming up with my friend, Fauzan to work on this project. The dataset that being used is data on suicide rates and socioeconomic conditions from 1990 to 2022.


# A. Backgroud Problem 
The issue of suicide is a complex public health concern with multiple aspects that impact societies worldwide. It is not solely a result of individual mental health conditions but is significantly influenced by social, economic, and demographic factors. Understanding suicide patterns and correlations can aid in developing effective prevention strategies. Given that the dataset includes economic indicators alongside suicide rates, this indicates an interest in exploring how these economic factors correlate with suicide occurrences across different demographics and over time.

# B. Objective
1. Analyze the suicide dataset from the period 1990 to 2022 to identify trends and patterns associated with spikes in suicide rates.
2. Investigate factors that may trigger an increase in suicide rates, especially based on socioeconomic factors.
3. Understand the relationships between factors that contribute to high suicide rates.
4. Develop solutions and recommendations aimed at reducing suicide rates.


# C. Goals
To explore the relationship between the suicide rate and socioeconomic conditions and other demographic factors, and then to assess in more detail the interaction between those causes. The longer-term goal is to produce policy recommendations and interventions that can help prevent suicide.


# D. Work flow
The work flow in this project is:

    - 1. Finding dataset 
    - 2. Dataset cleaning which includes:
        * Rename values
        * Remove duplicated data
        * Checking unknown values of categorical data 
        * Deleting unnecessary columns
        * Checking missing values on each column
        * Deleting missing values on certain column 
        * Handling missing values on GDP, GDPPerCapita, GrossNationalIncome, and GNIPerCapita columns     
    - 3. Save and download cleaned dataset
    - 4. Visualization with tableau
    - 5. Data analytics to gain insight and give recommendation 
    - 6. Creating dashboard and report


# E. File Description
1. The 'code_cleansing.ipynb' module is a program used to perform data cleansing.
2. The file 'suicide_rates_1990-2022.csv' is the dataset used for the cleaning process. 
3. The file 'cleaned_suicide_rates_1990-2022.csv' is the cleaned dataset that will be used for visualization and analysis.
